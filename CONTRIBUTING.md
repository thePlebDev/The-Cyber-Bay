# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in Cyber Bay! We are open to, and grateful for, any contributions made by the community. We want Cyber Bay to be a community endeavour, all of us working together to make Android Development more accessible for folks!

The most important thing to be aware of is that Cyber Bay! is a side-project without any full-time staff. As a result, we can't guarantee that issues or pull-requests will be addressed or reviewed in a timely fashion (although we'll certainly try!).

We'd also like to emphasize that, outside of specific cases like quick bug fixes, we'd prefer if **pull requests were opened in response to issues** (and ideally ones that have a consensus already established as to the solution). We don't want to have to reject a pull request because we disagree with the direction or the implementation.
