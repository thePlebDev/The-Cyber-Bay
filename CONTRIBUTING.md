# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in Cyber Bay! We are open to, and grateful for, any contributions made by the community. We want Cyber Bay to be a community endeavour, all of us working together to make Android Development more accessible for folks!

The most important thing to be aware of is that Cyber Bay! is a side-project without any full-time staff. As a result, we can't guarantee that issues or pull-requests will be addressed or reviewed in a timely fashion (although we'll certainly try!).

We'd also like to emphasize that, outside of specific cases like quick bug fixes, we'd prefer if **pull requests were opened in response to issues** (and ideally ones that have a consensus already established as to the solution). We don't want to have to reject a pull request because we disagree with the direction or the implementation.
## Feature requests & contribution enquiries

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea
fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to *you* to make a strong
case for the inclusion of your feature. Please provide as much detail and
context as possible.

Contribution enquiries should take place before any significant pull request,
otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that we might
have good reasons for rejecting.

## Pull requests

Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic
help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated
commits.

Make sure to adhere to the coding conventions used throughout the codebase
(indentation, accurate comments, etc.) and any other requirements (such as test
coverage).

Please follow this process; it's the best way to get your work included in the
project:

1. Create a new topic branch to contain your feature, change, or fix:

2. Commit your changes in logical chunks. Provide clear and explanatory commit
   messages.

3. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:

4. Push your topic branch up to your fork:
